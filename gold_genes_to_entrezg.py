"""pal-1 encodes a homeodomain protein that is the C. elegans Caudal ortholog; PAL-1 is required maternally and embryonically for specification of the C and D posterior blastomere fates and thus, for proper bodywall muscle and hypodermal development during embryogenesis; PAL-1 is also required postembryonically for fate specification of the posterior V6 neuroectoblast during male tail development; in regulating embryonic bodywall muscle specification, PAL-1 binds to an enhancer element in the promoter of hlh-1, the sole C. elegans MRF family member, to positively regulate hlh-1 transcription; PAL-1 is expressed in posterior blastomeres beginning at the four-cell stage of embryogenesis and its expression continues during embryogenesis in posterior-derived tissues and cells undergoing movement or forming midline structures; pal-1 is subject to both transcriptional and translational regulation."""
